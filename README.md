## Project Description
    - People are only handicapped when the world around them does not adjust itself to enhance accessibility, creating an equitable world. If glasses, contacts, and lasik surgery never existed, millions of people would be living at a major disadvantage. Enhancing accessibility in web spaces is one step towards building that equitable world.
    - The code given on this project did not meet those accesibility standards and needed my adjustments to meet that goal.
    - I fixed the title of the page, as it was lacking any specificity; I updated the html elements to give it semantic html, so that code reads in a more logical, organized manner; I gave all images on the page alt attributes (or equivalent), including the heart emoji in the footer, so that screen readers can actually process each image; adjusted the heading in the footer to H1 for visual aesthetics and because it makes more sense having its own heading rather than a sub-heading. I only made one adjustment to the CSS where a "div" element was incorrectly labeled and needed to be changed to "nav."
    - I learned how to better identify accessibility failings in a web page and how to quickly adjust them to make sure the page is accessible to as many people as possible.
